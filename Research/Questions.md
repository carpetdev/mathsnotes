     - How many binary operations
         - How many associative
     - Counting up to isomorphisms / more interesting kind of equivalences
         - Anti-isomorphism
         - Clone equivalence (find paper)
     - 2-gates
         - Do 2-gates generate n-gates
         - What concepts generalise
             - Minimal generating sets (2-gates have generating set size 1)
             - Imply only interesting gate (small isomorphism classes are interesting?)
     - Probability
         - Test for associativity

     - Magma for every finite set size - but not a boring algorithm. symmetric group is a monoidal diagonal category. can we think of a magmoid
 - [[Magmoid Theory]]
     - How do big theorems in category theory parallel into magmoid theory - why not?
