 - Examples of magmoids
 - [[Finite Magmas]]
     - How many binary operations
         - How many associative
     - Magma for every finite set size - but not a boring algorithm. symmetric group is a monoidal diagonal category. can we think of a magmoid
     - Counting up to isomorphisms / more interesting kind equivalences
         - Anti-isomorphism
         - Clone equivalence (find paper)
     - 2-gates
         - Do 2-gates generate n-gates
         - What concepts generalise
             - Minimal generating sets (2-gates have generating set size 2)
             - Imply only interesting gate (small isomorphism classes are interesting?)
     - Probability
         - Test for associativity
         - Statistics sampling from Cayley tables
     - Subcategory of magmas (like symmetric group)
 - [[Magmoid Theory]]
     - How do big theorems in category theory parallel into magmoid theory - why not?
     - Free magmoid
     - Magma congruences
     - Monad
 - [[Concrete Magmoids]]
     - Generalise/modify examples in [[Torzewska - Motion Groupoids.pdf]]
     - What morphisms exist from the object of the circle intersect with rational lattice on the cube (in the motion and mapping class groupoid of cube)
         - We're thinking towards doing continuum field theory computation on a lattice
