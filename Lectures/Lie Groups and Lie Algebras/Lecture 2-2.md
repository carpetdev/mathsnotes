A **Lie group** $G$ is a group which is a smooth manifold such that the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are smooth. We usually denote the identity as $e$.

Let $U$ be a neighbourhood of $e\in G$ with local coordinates putting $e$ at $(0,0,\dots,0)$. Take an element $x\in U$ with coordinates $(x^1,\dots,x^n)$ and $y\in U$ with coordinates $(y^1,\dots,y^n)$. If we multiply them, then the components of $z=x\cdot y$ are smooth functions of $x$ and $y$: $z^k=z^k(x^1,\dots,x^n,y^1,\dots,y^n)$.

Proposition:
$z^k=x^k+y^k+\sum_{i,j}b_{ij}^kx^iy^j+\cdots$ (terms of degree $\geq 3$). Similarly, if we consider the inversion map $x\mapsto u=x^{-1}$, then $u^k=-x^k+\sum_{i,j}b_{ij}^kx^ix^j+\cdots$ (terms of degree $\geq 3$).

Proof:
In general, the Taylor expansion of an arbitrary smooth function can be written with summation convention as $z^k=a_0+l_jx^j+m_jy^j+a_{ij}x^ix^j+b_{ij}x^iy^j+c_{ij}y^iy^j+\cdots$. To find coefficients, we set $x=e$ to get $y^k=a_0+m_jy^j+c_{ij}y^iy^j+\cdots$. Thus, $a_0=0,\ c_{ij}=0,\ m_j = \delta_{kj}$. Similar for $y=e$ shows that $a_{ij}=0, l_j=\delta_{kj}$. $\blacksquare$

Any smooth manifold $M$ can be presented as a disjoint union of connected (equivalently, path-connected) manifolds called **connected components** of $M$. Let $G$ be a Lie group, and $G=G_0\cup G_1\cup\dots$ be the decomposiiton into connected components with $G_0$ the connected component of the identity $e$.

Theorem:

1. $G_0$ is a normal subgroup in $G$
2. $G_0$ is a Lie group
3. Any connected component is diffeomorphic to $G_0$

Proof:
If $a(t)$ is a path connecting $a$ to $e$, and $b(t)$ for $b$, then ${} a(t)b(t)^{-1} {}$ connects ${} ab^{-1} {}$ to $e$. Note $gG_0g^{-1}$ is a connected component of $G$ since left and right mulitiplication are diffeomorphisms, so it must be the component of $e$. $\blacksquare$

Theorem:
Let $U$ be any connected neighbourhood of $e\in G$. Then $G_0$ is generated by $U$ in the sense that any element can be represented as $x=u_1u_2\dots u_k$ with $u_i\in U$.

Remark:

1. If $U$ is a neighbourhood of $e$, then $aU$ and $Ua$ are diffeomorphic neighbourhoods of $a$
2. The set $U^{-1}=\{u^{-1}\mid u\in U\}$ is a neighbourhood of $e$

Proof:
Set $L=\bigcup_{k\geq 1}U^k$. Want to show $L=G_0$. $L$ is open as the union of open sets and closed as $a\in G\setminus L$ has the neighbourhood $aU^{-1}$ which is disjoint from $L$. $L$ is connected since any product has a path to $e$ as the product of paths of its factors to $e$. $\blacksquare$

An **algebraic linear group** $G$ is a subgroup in $\GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ which is defined by a system of polynomial equations $$\begin{gather}
p_1(a_{11},a_{12},\dots,a_{nn})=0\\ \vdots\\ p_m(a_{11},a_{12},\dots,a_{nn})=0
\end{gather}$$
where $a_{ij}$ are matrix components of $A\in\GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. Also works for $\mathbb{C}$.

Example:
- $\sl(n,\mathbb{R})$ is given by $\det A = 1$
- $\o(n)$ is given by $n(n+1)/2$ equations; $\so(n)$ has one additional equation
- The upper triangular group is given by $n(n-1)/2$ equations of the form $a_{ij}=0$

Theorem:
Any algebraic linear group $G$ is a Lie subgroup in $\GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. In particular, $G$ is a Lie group.

Proof Sketch:
The main statement is that $G$ is a smooth submanifold. We need to explain why singular points don't appear in this setting. The reason is *homogeneity*, i.e. any subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$ has the same smooth structure at each of its points. More precisely, take a neighbourhood of $e$ in $G$ as $U_e=G\cap V\subseteq G$, where $V$ is a certain neighbourhood of $e\in GL(n,\mathbb{R})$. Then for any other point $x\in G$, we can consider its neighbourhood $U_x$ obtained by left translation: $U_x=x\cdot(G\cap V)=G\cap(x\cdot V)$, a diffeomorphism. For algebraic submanifolds, almost all points are non-singular, so we must have that all point are non-singular in this case due to homogeneity.

This theorem is implied by the following two theorems.

Theorem (Cartan):
Any closed subgroup of a Lie group is a smooth submanifold and, therefore, a Lie subgroup.

Theorem (A. Skopenkov):
Let $M\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed subset satisfying the following homogeneity condition: for any two points $a,b\in M$, there are neighbourhoods $U_a,U_b\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and a diffeomorphism $F$ sending $U_a$ onto $U_b$ such that $F(U_a\cap M)=U_b\cap M$ and $F(a)=b$. Then $M$ is a smooth submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
