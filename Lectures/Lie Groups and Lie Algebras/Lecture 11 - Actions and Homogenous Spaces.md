Let $G$ be a Lie group and $M$ a smooth manifold. An **action** of $G$ on $M$ is a group action $F\colon G\times M\to M$ such that $F$ is smooth. Note that $\hat{a} \coloneqq F(a,\cdot)$ is a diffeomorphism., so we may think of the action as a map $\hat{\phantom{x}}\colon G \to \Diff(M)$ which is a homomorphism of groups (or even a homomorphism of Lie groups if we think of $\Diff(M)$ as an infinite-dimensional Lie group).
