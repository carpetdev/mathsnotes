# Definition
A **ring** is a non-empty [[set]] $R$ with two [[associative]] binary operations, the addition $R\times R \to R,\ (x, y) \mapsto x+y$, and the multiplication $R\times R\to R,\ (x,y)\mapsto xy$, such that:
1. $(R,+)$ is an abelian [[group]] with identity $0_{R}$
2. There exists a ring identity $1_{R} \in{R\setminus \left\{ 0_{R} \right\}}$ such that $x 1_{R} = 1_{R}x = x$ for all $x\in R$
3. Multiplication distributes over addition

A ring is **commutative** if its multiplication is. ^6fdfc7
# Example
1. $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$ with their usual operations are commutative rings
2. The **polynomial ring** $$R[X]=\left\{ \sum_{i=0}^na_{i}x_{i} : n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0},\ a_{0}, \dots, a_{n}\in R \right\}$$ is a commutative ring if $R$ is
3. $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is *not* a ring
4. For $n\geq1$, the set $M_{n}(K)$ of $n\times n$ matrices with entries in a field [[Notation#$K$]] with its usual operations is a ring. It is commutative if and only if $n=1$
