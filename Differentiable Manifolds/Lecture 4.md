Example:
- Any open subset $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a smooth manifold with a single chart $(U,\text{id})$.
- The sphere $S^n\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ (with the relative topology), where $S^n=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\mid x_1^2+\dots+x_{n+1}^2=1\}$, is a smooth manifold. $U_\pm=S^n\setminus\{(0,\dots,0,\pm 1)\}$, $\phi_\pm\colon \mathbb{R}^{n+1}\to \mathbb{R}^n$, $\phi_\pm(\underbrace{x_1,\dots,x_n}_{\bar{x}},x_{n+1})=\frac{\bar{x}}{1\mp x_{n+1}}$. Given $p=\phi_+(x_1,\dots,x_{n+1}) = \frac{\bar{x}}{1-x_{n+1}}$, $|p|^2=\frac{1-x_{n+1}^2}{(1-x_{n+1})^2}=\frac{1+x_{n+1}}{1-x_{n+1}}$. Therefore, $x_{n+1}=\frac{|p|^2-1}{|p|^2+1}$. Similarly, $\bar{x}=\frac{2p}{|p|^2+1}$. Thus, $\tau_{-+}\phi_-\circ\phi_+^{-1}(p)=\frac{p}{|p|^2}$. So $\tau_{-+}$ is smooth on $\phi_+(U_+\cap U_-) = \mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$. Note that $\tau_{-+}^2=\text{id}$, so $\tau_{-+}=\tau_{+-}$ and the latter is also smooth on $\phi_-(U_+\cap U_-)$.
- Any topological space X homeomorphic to a smooth manifold can be given the structure of a smooth manifold by going through the homeomorphism and using the same differentiable structure. E.g. the square by using the radial projection homeomorphism to the circle.
