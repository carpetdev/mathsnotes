# A categorical perspective on Braid representations
- Strict monoidal category = category with associative bifunctor $\otimes\colon\cat{C}\times \cat{C}\to \cat{C}$ which an object $\mathbb{1}_\cat{C}$ that is a left and right identity for $\otimes$
- Braid category $B$ = objects given by points, monoidal product is taking union of points, morphisms are braidings, monoidal product by stacking horizontally, composition by stacking vertically.
    - $B(n,m)$ is braid group for $n=m$, empty otherwise
- Category $B'$ is the strict monoidal groupoid with object monoid $(\mathbb{N},+)$ as above, and one generating morphism $\sigma$ satisfying $\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_1=\sigma_2\sigma_1\sigma_1$. We get $B'\cong B$
- $\mathbf{Mat}$ is a monoidal category with Kronecker product of matrices and object monoid $(\mathbb{N},+)$
- For us, braid representations are strict monoidal functors $F\colon B\to \mathbf{Mat}$, so are determined by $N=F(1)$ and a invertible matrix $R=F(\sigma)$ in $\mathbf{Mat}(N\times N,N\times N)$ such that $R_1R_2R_1=R_2R_1R_2$ where $R_1=R\otimes 1$, $R_2=1\otimes R$
    - In general this is hard!
    - These representations are exactly solutions to the YBE
- $\mathbf{MonFun}(B,\mathbf{Mat})$ is the category with objects strict monoidal functors and morphisms monoidal natural transformations: $Q\colon (M,S)\to (N,R)$ satisfies $(Q\otimes Q)S = R(Q\otimes Q)$
- Problem 1: Fix a subcategory of $\mathbf{Mat}$ and classify functors to this up to equivalence
- Problem 2: Find subcategories of $\mathbf{MonFun}$ amenable to classification

## Problem 1
- For $N\in \mathbb{N}$, $\mathbf{Mat}^N$ is the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Mat}$ with object monoid generated by $N$ ($N$, $N^2$, $N^3$, $\dots$) and relabel objects by their powers. Can label rows and columns morphisms $i\to i$ by words of length $i$
    - Every representation has image in some $\mathbf{Mat}^N$
    - Elements of $\mathbf{MonFun}(B,\mathbf{Mat}^2)$ are completely classified, up to local isomorphism (Hietarinta, 1992)
- A matrix is charge conserving if $M_{w,w'} = \langle w | M | w' \rangle \neq 0$ implies $w$ is a permutation of $w'$
    - Braid representations with target $\mathbf{Match}^N$ which preserve the object $1$ are classified (Rowell, Martin)
- Matrix is additive charge conserving if $M_{vw}\neq 0$ implies $\sum v = \sum w$
    - Solutions to $\mathbf{Matcha}^3$ are classified (Hieterinta, Rowell, Martin)
- Matrix is monomial if there is exactly one non-zero entry in each row and column
- Matrix is permutation if it is monomial and each non-zero entry is 1
    - $\ob(\mathbf{MonFun}(B,\mathbf{PermMat}^N))$ is classified up to $N = 10$
    - Proposition: Suppose $(N,R)\in \mathbf{MonFun}(B,\mathbf{MonMat})$ and let $R^\times$ be the matrix obtained by replacing all non-zero entries by 1. Then $(N,R^\times)$ works for $\mathbf{PermMat}$

## Problem 2
- A braided strict monoidal category is a strict monoidal category with a natural isomorphism $B\colon \otimes\to \otimes^\mathrm{co}$, i.e. for each $x,y\in \ob(\cat{C})$ an isomorphism $B_{x,y}\colon x\otimes y\to y \otimes x$ satisfying an associativity property
- $\mathbf{Mat}$ is a braided monoidal category with braiding $c_{X,Y}$ given by $\ket{ij}\mapsto \ket{ji}$
- $[\chi\boxtimes\gamma]\coloneqq (\id_X \otimes c_{X,Y}^{-1}\otimes \id_Y)(\chi\otimes\gamma)(\id_X\otimes c_{Y,X}\otimes \id_Y)$ is called the lashing product and gives a strict monoidal category $\mathbf{MonFun}(B,\mathbf{Mat})$
- $Q\colon (M,S)\to (N,R)$ with $N\geq M$ is a monomorphism if $Q$ is full rank and this is a subobject, $P\colon (N,R)\to (M,S)$ is an epimorphism if $P$ is full rank and this is a quotient object
- An object is called simple if all subobjects and quotient objects are isomorphisms

---

- Let $(N,R)\in \mathbf{MonFun}(B,\mathbf{Mat})$ and $W\otimes W$ an $R$-invariant subspace of $\mathbb{C}^N\otimes \mathbb{C}^N$ with $\dim(W)=M$. Then there is a subobject $Q\colon M\to N$ where the mono $Q$ is such that $Q(\mathbb{C}^M)=W$
- Charge conserving objects $(N,R)\in \mathbf{MonFun}(B,\mathbf{Match}^N)$ with $N>1$ are never simple. They have subobjects of the form $Q\colon M\to N$ for every $M\leq N$
- $R\in \mathbf{Mat}^N(2,2)$ is of group-type if there are $g_i\in GL(N)$ such that for all $i,j$, $R\ket{ij}=g_i\ket{j}\otimes\ket{i}$
