# Inverse semigroups
- $S$ semigroup if magma and for all $s$ there is a unique $s^{-1}$ such that $ss^{-1}s=s$ and $s^{-1}ss^{-1}=s^{-1}$
- $X$ any set, symmetric inverse monoid $\operatorname{SIM}(X)$ is partial functions from $X$ to $X$ which are bijective between domain and range
- $B_X\leq \operatorname{SIM}(X)$ is functions with one element in their domain. Can consider these as matrices with a single 1
- $X$ set with at least two elements, $X^*$ is finite words and $X^\omega$ is (right) infinite words
- Polycyclic inverse monoid $\mathcal{P}_X\leq\operatorname{SIM}(X^\omega)$ generated by $x_i$ where $x_i(w) = x_iw$. Have $x_i^{-1}(x_iw)= w$
    - $x_i^{-1}x_j(w) = \begin{cases}\text{undefined}& i\neq j\\ w& i=j\end{cases}$ so have $x_i^{-1}x_j = \delta_{i,j}$
    - $\mathcal{P}_X = \{\alpha\beta^{-1} \mid \alpha,\beta\in X^*\}\cup \{0\}$, $\alpha\beta^{-1}\colon \beta X^\omega\to \alpha X^\omega$ is a normal form
        - $\alpha\beta^{-1}\cdot \gamma\delta^{-1} = \begin{cases}\alpha\varepsilon\delta^{-1} & \beta\varepsilon=\gamma\\ \alpha\varepsilon^{-1}\delta^{-1} & \beta=\gamma\varepsilon\\ 0 & \text{else}\end{cases}$
- $e\in S$ is idempotent if $e^2=e$
    - $\operatorname{SIM}(X)$ has idempotents $id_Y$ for $Y\subseteq X$
- $ef = fe$ in inverse semigroups for two idempotents, so their product is also an idempotent
- $E=E(S)$ is the inverse subsemigroup of idempotents
    - For $\operatorname{SIM}(X)$, we can identitfy $E$ with $(\mathbb{P}(X), \cap)$. Have a partial order ${} e\leq f \iff ef=e {}$
    - For $\mathcal{P}_X$ we get $\{\alpha\alpha^{-1} \mid \alpha\in X^*\}\cup\{0\}$. Have partial order from prefixes
- $F$ field, $S$ inverse semigroup with $0$, $FS$ semigroup algebra, $F_0S$ contracted semigroup algebra (quotient out the zeros)
    - $S = B_X$, $|X|=n$, $F_0S=\mat{n}{F}$ simple
- When is $F_0S$ simple?
- $F_0S$ simple ${} \implies {}$ $S$ shouldn't have any quotients (i.e. is congruence-free). The converse is not true
- If $|X|\geq 2$, $\mathcal{P}_X$ is congruence-free.
- If $|X|<\infty$, then $F_0\mathcal{P}_X$ is not simple
    - We extend $\mathcal{P}_X \curvearrowright X^\omega$ to $F_0\mathcal{P}_X\curvearrowright FX^\omega$. E.g. $1-x$ acts on something starting with $x$ by $0$ and on something else by prepending $x$.
    - $F_0\mathcal{P}_X$ simple $\implies$ this action is faithful
    - Consider $a = 1-\sum_{x\in X}x x^{-1}$. Then $a$ acts as $0$ on all words., so the action is not faithful and this algebra isn't simple
- If $|X|=\infty$, then ${} F_0\mathcal{P}_X$ is simple, if $|X|<\infty$, then $F_0\mathcal{P}_X$ quotiented by kernel of above action is simple
- $E$ semilattice is strongly disjunctive if for all $0<e_1,\dots,e_n\leq e$, there exists $0\neq f\leq e$ such that $fe_i=0$ for all $i$
- If $F_0S$ simple then:
    - $S$ is congruence-free
    - E is strongly disjunctive
- Converse not true. Take $\mathcal{P}_X$ with $X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots\}$ together with some extra elements:
    - $\sigma\in \operatorname{SIM}(X^\omega)$, $\sigma(x_{2i}w')=x_{2i+1}w'$, $\sigma(x_{2i+1}w') = x_{2i}w'$.
    - $b(x_{2i}w') = x_{2i}\sigma(w')$ but does nothing on odd starting words. $c$ does the opposite (applies $\sigma$ to odd starting words only)
    - Let $S=\langle \mathcal{P}_X, \sigma, b, c \rangle$. $S$ is congruence-free and $E$ is strongly disjunctive
    - Set $a=1-b-c-bc$. This acts as 0 on $F_0X^\omega$, so $F_0S$ is not simple
    - A similar thing with $b,c,d$ acting on elements via mod 3 parity (leave one unfixed) not simple if and only if $\char{F}=2$
- Theorem (Ben Steinberg, Nora):
    - $S$ inverse semigroup with 0. $F_0S\curvearrowright F\widehat{E}_\infty$ (ultrafilter stuff)
    - $F_0S$ is simple $\iff$ $S$ congruence-free and the kernel of action is 0
    - The kernel is $\{a\in F_0S \mid (\forall e\in E)(\exists 0\neq f\leq e)(af=0)\}$
