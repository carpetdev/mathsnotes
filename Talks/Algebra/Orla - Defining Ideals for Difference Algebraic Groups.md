- Difference ring ($\sigma$-ring) is a ring with set $\sigma$ of pairwise commuting endomorphisms
    - [[Orla - The Ascending Chain Condition for Difference Ideals]]
- Smallest difference ideal containing $F\subseteq R$ is denoted $[F]$
- Can have difference algebras if the structure map is a morphism of difference rings
    - $K\{F\}$ is the smallest $K$-$\sigma$-subalgebra of $R$ containing $F$ (apply all transforms = combinations of endomorphisms)

- An affine scheme of finite type over $K$ is a functor from $K$-$\cat{Alg}$ to $\cat{Set}$ that is isomorphic to ${} \operatorname{Hom}_{K\text{-}\cat{Alg}}(A,-) {}$ for some finitely generated $K$-algebra $A$
    - An algebraic group over $K$ is an affine scheme of finite type whose representing algebra is a $K$-Hopf algebra
- A $\sigma$-variety is a functor from $K$-$\sigma$-$\cat{Alg}$ to Hom_$K$-$\sigma$-$\cat{Alg}$(A,-) for some finitely $\sigma$-generated $K$-$\sigma$-algebra.
    - A $\sigma$-algebraic group over $K$ is a $\sigma$-variety whose reprenting K@salgebra is a K@sHopf algebra

- Have universal property giving K@s-algebra from K-algebra
- Can embed (isomorphism to $\sigma$-closed subgroup) any $\sigma$-algebraic group in one of these constructions for an algebraic group
    - Can also find a $\sigma$-Hopf ideal that gives the coordinate ring as a quotient (and a converse)
