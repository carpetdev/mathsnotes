- For a profinite group, take an inverse limit of finite groups (with discrete topology). The limit has an interesting topology.
    - Equivalently take a compact Hausdorff totally-disconnected topological group
    - p-adic integers are inverse limit of $p^n$ cyclic groups
    - Galois groups of algebraic field extensions are profinite groups
    - Matrix groups over p-adics are also inverse limits
- The completed group algebra $\mathbb{K}[[G]]$ is the inverse limit of the group algebras (with discrete topology)
    - If $\mathbb{K}$ is finite, the completed group algebra is compact. In general, it's called a pseudocompact algebra
    - For p-adics, we get formal power series if field is characteristic. else have infinite direct product of the field (when algebraically closed?)
    - This algebra decomposes as direct product of blocks (given by ideal generated by primitive idempotents of the centre)
    - In general not Noetherian even if the blocks are
- To a block we can attach a pro-$p$-subgroup called the defect group, unique up to conjugation. If it's finite, then the block is isomorphic to a block of a finite group
