- Peripheral system is the Wirtinger group with a meridian and longitude (elements of the group)
- Counting invariant is $I_G(K) = \lvert \operatorname{Hom}(W(K),G) \rvert$
- Eisermann invariant is similar with a sum of images over homomorphisms
- Have Quantum Eisermann invariant where we consider the quantum double

- Fundamental $\pi$-module $(W(K),M(K),\rhd)$ is a strictly stronger invariant of welded knots than $W(K)$
    - $M(K)$ is $\mathbb{Z}[W(K)]\{\text{arcs}\}/\text{relations}$
    - $\pi$-module is group with action on an abelian group
    - This is finitely presented but the semidirect product of the groups is not going to be (arcs on a welded diagram are related by a conjugation in this semidirect product)

-  A **stolon link** is a graph such that each vertex is 1 or 3 valent with 1 valent vertices oriented outwraeds and 3 valent ones have 2 in 1 out
    - These might show that this higher peripheral system is stronger
