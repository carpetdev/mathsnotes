Have three orbit types for 2x2 JNF (diagonal same, diagonal same with a 1, diagonal not same). These form **decomposition classes** of 2x2 matrices. Label these $[(1,1)], [(2)], [(1),(1)]$ respectively, i.e. partitions into multisets of total sum 2.

Stabilisers easier to compute for JNF matrices. Can transform a stabiliser from JNF matrix to one in same orbit by conjugating it. In fact note thet stabiliser of JNF is independent of diagonal values as long as distinctiveness is maintained.

Can compute dimensions of stabilisers. Can put order via Zariski topology. All generalises to any $n$. 

Just care about stabilisers?. Are level sets always follow pattern.
