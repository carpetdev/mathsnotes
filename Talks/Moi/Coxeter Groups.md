# Errata
- Def 1.1 should be smallest normal subgroup
- Prop 2.2 $\pm\lambda$ mishaps
# Motivation/Abstract
- reflections
- can answer word problem
- finite ones are cool
# Talk
1. Symmetries of n-gon ($\pi/n$ between flips)
    - Finite
2. Triangle groups (in $\mathbb{E}^2$+)
    - $(2,3,6)$, $(2,4,4)$, $(3,3,3)$
    - Infinite (consider orbit)
    - Wallpaper groups
3. Coxeter system (free group mod normal closure)
    - Consider $\left< a,b \mid aba^{-1} = b^2, bab^{-1}=a^2\right>$. Have $a = b^2ab^{-1} = b^2a^2a^{-1}b^{-1}=b^3ab^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}=b^3b^{-2}b^{-1}$
4. Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams and examples
    - $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$
    - $D_\infty$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ on real line
    - Weyl groups of root systems (also all finite reflection groups have a root system)
    - Symmetric is n-simplex symmetries
    - Signed symmetric is from hypercube tesselation $B_n = A_n$ with extra point connected with 4
5. TFAE
    - $(W,S)$ Coxeter system
    - $(\operatorname{Cay}_S(W), \set{wsw^{-1}})$ is a reflection system (each reflection splits graph in two -- taking midpoints of flipped edges, or equivalently just the fixed set)
    - Exchange condition on $(W,S)$: if for reduced word $w$, the length of $ss_1\dots s_k$ is $< k$ then $w = ss_1\dots \hat{s_i} \dots s_k$
6. Can use exchange to prove Tits' solution to word problem (unsolvable uniformly for all groups)
    - Matsumoto theorem -- reduced word related by braid moves only
    - Reduced $\iff$ cannot be shortened by (i) deleting $ss$ (ii) braid move
    - Talk about word problem being hard in general?
7. Tits representation, each $\rho(s_i)=\sigma_i$ is a linear involution with fixed point set a hyperplane. $\sigma_i\sigma_j$ has order $m_{ij}$. $B(e_i,e_j) = -cos(\pi/m_{ij})$ ($-1$ if infinite) then $\rho(s_i)(v) = v-2B(e_i,v)e_i$
    - $s_i s_j$ must have order $m_{ij}$
    - It's faithful! So really everything is a sort of reflection group
    - Can also use this for proofs above instead of Cayley graph
8. Finite Coxeter groups
    - Classified by CD diagram
    - Finite $\iff$ $\rho$ positive definite $\iff$finite reflection group, from Tits and Weyl group (or can also see as spherical reflection group)
    - Longest word $\iff$ finite
9. Parabolic subgroups is group generated by subset of generators
    - This is same as coxeter group on full subgraph (not obvious as could be relations through other generators), by faithfulness of Tits
