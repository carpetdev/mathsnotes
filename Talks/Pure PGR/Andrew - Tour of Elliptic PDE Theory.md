- Holder continuity tells you how pointy something is
- Schauder estimate gives a bound on solution to elliptic PDE given some assumptions
- Can use existence of Laplace solution to give existence for Holder elliptic PDE solution (in $c$ negative case). Uniqueness is clear
- Fredholm alternative gives result for all $c$
